# 🚀 Open WebUI Prompt Plus: AI-Powered Prompt Manager & Spotlight Search

I'm excited to share **Prompt Plus**, a powerful extension designed to elevate your prompt engineering workflow within Open WebUI. It brings professional-grade management, AI-assisted generation, and a seamless spotlight-style interface to your daily AI interactions.

### 🌟 Why Prompt Plus?

If you find yourself struggling to manage hundreds of prompts or want a faster way to insert them without leaving your keyboard, this is for you.

*   **🤖 AI-Powered Generation**: Just describe what you need (e.g., "Python code reviewer"), and it generates a structured, variable-rich prompt for you. It even handles auto-categorization and title suggestions!
*   **⚡ Spotlight Quick Access**: Press `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P` anywhere to open a command palette. Fuzzy search your prompts by title, content, or tags instantly.
*   **📝 Interactive Forms**: Unlock the full power of Open WebUI's native variable syntax. No need to remember slash commands—Prompt Plus renders your `{{variables}}` into a beautiful form with **Dropdowns**, **Date Pickers**, **Sliders**, and **Color Pickers**.
*   **🌍 Multi-Language**: Fully localized in 10 languages (English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, French, German, Spanish, Dutch, Greek).
